# Work Life Balance
---

Laptops are terrible for work life balance they encourage chronic workaholics to take their work any and every where. Laptops are good for convience but terrible for balance if you lack the discipline to well stop working.

I once had a life and it was chalk full of regular human interaction in casual settings. Then I purchased my first MacBook Air, and my life was effectively ruined for the better. However I believe all things eventually come full circle and I can appreciate the value of good work life balance. Fostering a productive albeit healthy relationship with work is how you increase productivity. 

Step one is getting rid of the laptop and here's my thinking, bigger display, signifitcaly more powerful compute platform, healthier lifestyle as I will be forced to either sit or stand at my desk in order to work and more importantly I will be forced to leave my desk effectively stopping workin and resuming life. In reality my laptop is just as bad as scrolling endlessly through social media all day. I'm no longer present in the world it follows me where ever I go and I'm always immersed in my 13" screen oblivious to the world around me. Now when I go out in to the world I'm totaly distraction free and therefor forced to stop, look, listen and take it all in and be present in the moment with the world around me. 

That being said while my laptop has served me well it was time for a upgrade it can barely keep up with the LLM's I run locally and it's starting to become annoying. Shift has pivoted and while I was planning on spending $2500 ish for a MacBook Pro, that will now go towards a Monitor, and Desktop. The options are as follows and Apple Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Apple Mac Studio, Apple Mac Mini. 

The Pro Display XDR would be a splurge and completely blow my bduget out of the water, you can't put a price on work life balance so the $2500 is more or less a loose guidline so that I don't end up buying dual XDR displays and a rack of the Mac Pro Servers, financial guard rails if you will ðŸ˜‚. Nonetheless I'm willing to invest in 1 XDR display if I can objectively justify it past the well "it just looks cool" factor and it add value to my life then yes it's a viable option but right now the pragmatic me is like a Mac Mini and Studio Display are more than enough and then some.

And the winner is ..... Mac Studio M4 Max Spec'd with 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores and Pro Display XDR I went with the XDR for the simple fact I do a lot of design work and the XDR is justifiable in that sense.
