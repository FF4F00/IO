### Concept: A High-Performance, Native Obsidian Alternative

**Objective**: To create a high-performance alternative to Obsidian by rewriting the application in **Rust**, with native integrations and a wide array of features aimed at enhancing productivity, collaboration, and development workflows.

#### Key Features:

1. **Performance and Native Integrations**:
    
    - **Rust-based core** for optimal performance.
        
    - Native integrations for executing various languages directly within the app, including **Zig**, **C23**, **Mojo**, **SQL**, **Rust**, **Go**, **Haskell**, **Python**, **TypeScript**, **CSS**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Kotlin**, **Swift**.
        
2. **Enhanced Productivity Tools**:
    
    - **Whiteboards**: Support for Kanban boards, mood boards, and canvas-style whiteboards.
        
    - **Planners & Schedulers**: Built-in tools for calendars, timers, reminders, and task scheduling.
        
3. **LLM (Large Language Model) Integration**:
    
    - Modular support for LLMs, enabling advanced AI-driven assistance and content generation.
        
    - Integration with GitHub and GitLab for code and project management.
        
4. **Database and Data Management**:
    
    - Use of **SurrealDB** as the underlying database for efficient data storage and querying.
        
5. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
    
    - Built-in real-time collaboration features, allowing teams to work together seamlessly.
        
6. **APIs and External Integrations**:
    
    - **Stock and Crypto API** integration for financial data.
        
    - **Weather API** for real-time weather updates.
        
    - **Storj Integration** for decentralized cloud storage.
        
    - **Shuttler.rs** for publishing content to the web.
        
7. **Development and Code Support**:
    
    - Native support for **Vim bindings** for advanced text editing.
        
    - Integration with **Ghostty shell** for terminal-like experiences.
        
    - **Spotify Controller** built-in for seamless music control during work.
        
    - Support for **Sourcegraph**, **Codeium**, and **LSP** (Language Server Protocol) for code navigation, completion, and suggestions.

### Vision:

By combining powerful features like language execution, LLM integration, real-time collaboration, and seamless external API integrations, this platform aims to not only compete with existing tools like Obsidian but surpass them in terms of performance, extensibility, and user experience. The goal is to build a tool that becomes indispensable for both personal productivity and team collaboration in any field.
