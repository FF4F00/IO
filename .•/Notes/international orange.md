conesus based funding what if the blockchain was a vc firm backing the best ideas allowing everybody to participate in wealth creation economy, allowing investors to make gains on early and late stage startups idea to ico... 

the idea is simple 
private - 
public - 

instead of buying coins you're buyimg a stake in an actual company early investors have the highest risk and oppertunity, once a company goes public and is generally available

the major selling point is that this is less friction than the fiat stock excahnge way where companies need to first bootstrap, then secure vc funding, then eventually IPO, if all goes right. This puts the power of creation back in the hands of everyday people, bet on the right horse and you can win big. 

Companies are literly funded from day 1, this negates the need to go out and traverse the maze of ventrue capital funding.

example:

company bespoke tech has private auction of about 100,000 shares for 10% of the company the way auctions work is that it locks in the aution price for that amount of shares and whatever amount of money lets say $100m, the company is trying to raise is divided up evenly among shares, but this doesn't mean investors can't but 1000 or 10 worth it just means the avialiable supply will sale at this price until its exhuasted, once an auction closes that price is no longer guranteed, shares are tokens on the lightening network this ensures if the company goes bust the investors can alaways get their money back out throught the brokerage firm, the tokens are just bit coin at the end of the day and can be cashed in for bitcoin which the investor can then convert to fiat if they so choose.

**Structure** – The underlying framework of the layout.    
**Aesthetics** – The visual appeal and beauty of the design.
**Gestalt** – Design principles based on how humans perceive visual elements.
**Execution** – The implementation of design concepts with precision.

Example Synopsis {
The **Syntax** ( _principles_ ) section focuses on the structural rules that govern how code is written and organized in programming languages. Syntax provides the foundation for creating programs by defining how various elements (e.g., data types, operators, and keywords) interact and combine to form meaningful instructions. This section breaks down syntax into key categories, enabling learners to systematically approach the process of writing and interpreting code.

# Types

## Primitives
Start by introducing the basic building blocks of types, as these are essential to understanding how all types work.

- **Int**: The fundamental integer type, representing whole numbers.
- **Float**: The floating-point type, which handles decimal numbers and precision.
- **Char**: The character type, representing individual symbols.
- **Bool**: The Boolean type, used for logical values (True/False).

---

## Composite Types
After mastering the primitives, dive into composite types that are made up of combinations of basic types or other composite types.

### Linear Types
Start with **Linear Types**, which consist of sequential or ordered elements. These are the easiest to understand and provide the foundation for more complex data structures.

#### Sequential
Begin with **static structures** that are simple to grasp before exploring more dynamic concepts.

- **Static**
  - **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
  - **Tuple**: A collection that can hold multiple types together in a fixed-size structure.
  - **Vector**: A more advanced version of an array, offering additional functionality like dynamic resizing or SIMD support.

- **Dynamic**
  - **List**: A collection of elements that can grow or shrink dynamically.
  - **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure, perfect for storing elements in an ordered sequence.

### Associative Types
Introduce **Associative Types** next, which represent relationships between elements via key-value pairs.

- **Dict**: A collection that associates keys with values for fast lookup.
- **Map**: Similar to a dictionary, but often more general and flexible.
- **Set**: A collection of unique elements, with no defined order.

---

## Non-Linear Types
These are more complex data structures that are essential once students have mastered linear and associative structures. They offer a deeper understanding of how data can be organized and connected.

### Hierarchical
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure where elements are arranged in parent-child relationships, commonly used for representing data like file systems or decision trees.

### Networked
- **Graph**: A more complex structure that consists of nodes connected by edges, widely used in scenarios like social networks, web links, and neural networks.

---

# Type Systems

## Type Structure

1. **Nominal vs Structural Typing**
   Understanding how types are identified and compared (fundamental concept).

2. **Manifest vs Inferred Typing**
   The difference between explicit type declaration and type inference (critical for understanding static/dynamic systems).

3. **Type Constructors**
   - **Product Types (Tuples)**
     Start with basic, compositional types.
   - **Sum Types (Unions)**
     Follow up with sum types, introducing the idea of variants.

4. **Type Abstraction**
   - **Type Aliases**
     Creating shorthand for types.
   - **Type Parameters**
     How polymorphic types (e.g., generics) work.

5. **Type Classes & Interfaces**
   Abstracting and using type classes in object-oriented languages.

6. **Subtyping**
   Understanding inheritance relationships and subtyping (advanced concept).

---

## Type Behavior

1. **Static vs Dynamic Typing**
   Core concepts of when types are checked—during compile-time vs runtime.

2. **Weak vs Strong Typing**
   Discuss the strength of typing and its flexibility impact.

3. **Type Checking vs Type Inference**
   Building on static/dynamic typing and exploring type handling (checked vs inferred).

4. **Type Safety**
   - **Type Soundness**
     Understanding the importance of type correctness before errors.
   - **Type Errors**
     Common errors and their relation to weak/strong typing systems.

5. **Dependent Types**
   Advanced types that depend on values.

6. **Polymorphism**
   - **Parametric Polymorphism (Generics)**
     Writing generic code, a key feature in many modern languages.
   - **Ad-hoc Polymorphism (Overloading)**
     Exploring function overloading and its use cases in polymorphic behavior.

7. **Gradual Typing**
   An advanced concept offering flexibility in type systems.

---

# Lifecycle

1. **Data Creation/Collection**: The initial gathering or generation of data, either through manual input, automated systems, sensors, or data acquisition from various sources.

2. **Data Storage**: The phase where data is stored in appropriate storage systems (e.g., databases, file systems, cloud storage) and organized for future access, retrieval, and analysis. This is typically divided into:
    
    - **Volatile (Ephemeral)** storage like RAM, cache, stack, heap, where data exists temporarily during processing.
    - **Non-Volatile (Persistent)** storage like disk storage, SSDs, and cloud systems, where data is saved long-term, either in structured (e.g., relational databases) or unstructured formats (e.g., files, NoSQL databases).

3. **Data Processing**: The stage where data is transformed, manipulated, or analyzed to derive meaningful information, insights, or support decision-making. This could involve operations like filtering, sorting, aggregating, or applying algorithms.

4. **Data Access**: Refers to how the data is retrieved for use, typically through queries (e.g., SQL queries, API calls) or other methods of access. This also includes mechanisms for controlling access, ensuring security, and maintaining privacy.

5. **Data Sharing and Distribution**: Data might be shared with other systems, users, or services, facilitating collaboration, reporting, or integration with other systems.

6. **Data Archival**: Once the data is no longer actively used but still has value for historical, regulatory, or reference purposes, it might be archived in a more cost-efficient storage system (e.g., cold storage, backups).

7. **Data Deletion**: This marks the end of the data lifecycle, where the data is either deleted or destroyed when it is no longer needed, or if it is subject to privacy or compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

I want 02L to be a platform where it walks you through step by step and shows you how to build a startup using AI, with the lowest overhead cost. 

  

  

Decenteralized Internet Will Cost Money The Concensus Network will have a package sort of like a cable package with decentralized options

- Network ( libp2p ) but brand name like cirqol ( decentralized communications platform )
- Compute ( users can pay with compute share where they are allowed access to the network simply by sharing compute resources
- Storage 
- Data

Turso - Initially Decentralized Data Layer ( each client controls access to their database ), Initially S3 but eventually Storj - Decentralized Storage Layer Each Client Controls Access to where their assets are stored. libp2p - Decentralized Network, Decentralized compute bespoke p2p distributed edge compute.

  

  

  

  

**Specialization**: Focusing on creating optimized solutions for specific tasks or domains, often by using specialized technologies or teams for different parts of the project (e.g., using the best tool for the job, splitting teams by expertise).

  

  

API

- Modular

  

UI/UX

  

**Generalization**: Taking a more holistic or unified approach, where a single tool, language, or team handles multiple tasks, often to simplify the development process and minimize overhead.

Important Points

- [Embedding Surrealist](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealist/advanced-topics/embedding-surrealist)
- [SurrealDB - Authentication](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication)
- AWS EC2 + Modular - Max (Self Managed) Globally Distributed CL End Point

- mojo code execution environment via restAPI

- AWS EC2 + SurrealDB (Self Hosted) Globally Distributed DL End Point

- Data redundancy (Self Hosted & Managed), parity with SurrealDB Cloud (Fully Managed)

  

  

Philosophical View Points

  

- Its better to build on existing infra see:

- Mojo
- Zig
- Typescript
- Deno
- SurrealDB
- Turso
- Neon

  

- Fully managed

- Network Layer

- Cloudflare top choice
- AWS R53 for redundancy

- Data Layer

- SurrealDB top choice
- Turso DB per user is the killer feature
- Neon if you need PSQL
- Cloudflare KV is you need a KV

- Fully Decentralized

- NL, DL, SL - This is where it counts 
- Turso enables users to actually own their data
- libp2p enables a decentralized network but cloudflare is nice in the interim
- Storj, Filecoin, IPFS, BTFS enable decentralized storage S3 and R2 are nice in the interim

We don't hire employees we have an open bounty system that anybody at any skill level can solve problems and claim bounties think of it as Github pull request but each request has a cash value solve a problem and earn some money, the more complex the problem the higher the payout, solutions must be accepted 1st by the automated ai system and second by a human tester who will test your code in pre-prod env to ensure it works once a solution has been merged the bounty can be claimed and is sent to the programmer in the form of bitcoin, all transactions happen on the blockchain, all payouts are in BTC, all bounties are smart contracts, all of the code must be written using our blockchain function registry think of it like lego blocks of primitive code that has been thoroughly vetted for safety but from these basic building blocks all complexity arises.

  

That being said in some instances we will hire 1099 workers to fulfill short, mid and long term contracts so essentially contractor positions, this is going to be a company built on AI, the goal is to hire 0 employees and grow the business to a unicorn as a proof of concept.

Empirical Analysis

  

Consumer - Identify three indispensable products and services analyze their significance. Reflect on their design, functionality, and how they integrate into your life. Discuss your journey as a customer, starting with their marketing appeal through to your day-to-day engagement. Highlight what differentiates these products from alternatives and why they resonate deeply with you.

  

Market - What are the names of the companies behind the products and services you listed, write them down and be sure to detail each companies respective market, market and business model. How would you describe your relationship with each company and explore the values and what emotions their brand evokes. Consider whether they foster loyalty, excitement, or trust, and why. What is the value proposition of each company.

  

Identify several industries that peak your interest rank them in descending order from most to least interesting. Identify the industries with the highest growth potential and compare both list.

  

≠ 0 : Split The Difference Between Passion & Opportunity

= 1 : Congratulations you found your problem space.

≥ 1 : Just pick one.

  

Fortunately for us the world's supply of problems far exceed the demand for solutions. So just find a problem space and fall in love. Identify the market leaders in your market, what is their value proposition, what's their business model, what problems are they solving. Identify market gaps or unmet needs by analyzing customer pain points, market trends and existing products and services. Identify potential for innovation in the problem space what products or services don't exist that could bring value to the marketplace. Identify any legislation that might present an opportunity to capture value.

  

Do you have founder market fit. Write down your skills and best qualities. How do they position you to solve problems in this space? Why are you uniquely positioned to solve this problem?

  

What does the data tell you about your assumptions. Research and validate multiple ideas and rank them most to least potential. Just start by creating a landing page that introduces your product or service to the public with a email list so users can sign-up. What do your analytics tell you about your product or service. The next step is to build out a minimum viable product and not a feature complete and polished product or service but as the name suggest the the least amount of work that creates the greatest amount of value for your users. It's pretty standard for tech startups to be pre-revenue but once you reach revenue that is a really strong signal of market validation as the market tends to vote with dollars, the final step is reaching profitability and thats as close to full validation as any company could ever get and its never quite 100% because of how dynamic the market can be but it's close enough to be considered a job well done.

  

4 Step Validation Process

  

  

  

Gamification everything has a TTL complete each mission, all work will be judged by AI assistant

Make it so that VC,s can browse startup profiles founders. VC's send founders a term sheet founders can counter offer and change certain terms but some aspects are immutable, mutable units of time, currency, shares. Term Sheets are smart contracts (BTC). Trying to lower the barrier to entry in terms of VC funding

  

VC dashboard will show the progress of there investments since every startup is being tracked, it takes the guess work out of projections, and risk assessment. 

  

  

  

  

Continuous Iteration / Continuous Validation

  

We're always in a state of validation thats where we want to live because at least that means we're not asleep

  

CI/CV

  

We are always validating our startups weather its the initial research, landing page and MVP, securing funding or generating revenue and finally reaching sustainability / profitability we are always validating, even after we achieve escape velocity and and IPO our level of success or validation is measured in how much we continue to increase shareholder value
