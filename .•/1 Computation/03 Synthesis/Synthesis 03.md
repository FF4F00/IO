**Synthesis** focuses on transitioning from theory to practice, empowering students to take full ownership of their work by deciding both **what to create** and **how to approach it**. This transformative stage fosters independence, creativity, and critical thinking, equipping students with tools to identify and validate problems, craft solutions, and implement them. By the end, each project reflects unique innovation and mastery.

Synthesis represents the culmination of everything learned so far. Up until this point, the book has guided students on **what to build** and **how to build it**. In Synthesis, however, students take full ownership—deciding both **what to create** and **how to approach it**.

The focus shifts to equipping students with tools to identify and validate problems, develop actionable plans, and design a roadmap for implementation. This stage is transformative: it encourages independence, self-confidence, and critical thinking. Without a predefined "right or wrong" answer, students must rely on their skills to test, iterate, and validate their solutions. By the end, every project will be uniquely tailored, reflecting each student's creativity and expertise.
