The **Syntax** section focuses on the structural rules that govern how code is written and organized in programming languages. Syntax provides the foundation for creating programs by defining how various elements (e.g., data types, operators, and keywords) interact and combine to form meaningful instructions. This section breaks down syntax into key categories, enabling learners to systematically approach the process of writing and interpreting code.
