## Syntax
Types
<hr>
The Types section covers the classification of data and variables in programming languages. It explains the distinction between primitive types, such as integers, floats, and booleans, and complex types like arrays, lists, and objects. Understanding types is crucial because they dictate how data can be manipulated, stored, and interacted with, ensuring proper memory allocation and efficient execution of code.

The **Primitives** section deals with the most basic data types provided by programming languages, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. These primitives form the building blocks of more complex data structures and operations. Understanding primitives is essential for efficient memory management and computational tasks, as they determine how the language handles basic data and operations.

---




#### Boolean
---
The `Bool` type represents a Boolean value, which can be either `True` or `False`. 



> Haskell 
```haskell
b :: Bool -> IO (); b x = print x
main :: IO (); main = do; b True
```

> C23

With C23 booleans are fully integrated into the language. The `bool` type and the `true`/`false` literals are now keywords, eliminating the need for `<stdbool.h>`. Additionally, scalar values are implicitly convertible to `bool`, enhancing type safety and making code more intuitive. This change ensures boolean logic is a core part of the language, improving consistency and readability.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void p(long long value, const char* format) {
    printf(format, value);
}

int main() {
    bool t = true;
    bool f = false;

    p(t, "%lld\n");
    p(f, "%lld\n");

    return 0;
}
// using legacy C99 booleans
// #include <stdbool.h>
```

> SQL 

```sql
-- surreal
DEFINE FIELD b AS BOOLEAN;

-- neon
CREATE TABLE types (b BOOLEAN);
```






#### Character
---

Char - The `Char` type represents a single Unicode character.

> Haskell 
```haskell
c :: Char  -> IO (); c x = print x
main :: IO (); main = do; c 'λ'
```

> C23
```c
// C23 examples
// char
// signed char
// unsigned char
```

> SQL
```sql
-- surreal
DEFINE FIELD c AS STRING;
DEFINE FIELD c AS STRING(1);

-- neon
CREATE TABLE types (c CHAR(50));
CREATE TABLE types (c VARCHAR(10));
```






#### Float
---


> Haskell 
```haskell
f :: Float -> IO (); f x = print x
main :: IO (); main = do; f 1.0
```

> C23

```c
// code goes here
```

> SQL

```sql

```


Float - he `Float` type represents a single-precision floating-point number (i.e., a decimal number).



```

#### Integer
---


Int - The `Int` type represents a fixed-precision integer (whole numbers). The exact range of values for `Int` is platform-dependent, but it's typically large enough for many applications (e.g., it can represent numbers in the range from `-2^29` to `2^29-1` on 32-bit systems).

> Haskell 
```haskell
i :: Int   -> IO (); i x = print x
main :: IO (); main = do; i 444
{--

Mastering flow control is essential for creating logic that responds dynamically to various conditions and user inputs.

3.003
<hr>
The **Contextual** section explores how the meaning of a piece of code can change depending on its surroundings. This includes scoping rules, variable lifetime, and how names and values are interpreted based on the context in which they appear. Understanding the context is key for debugging and maintaining clean code, as it ensures variables and functions are used correctly within their appropriate environments.



## Semantics

**Semantics** - is the study of the meaning of words, symbols, and phrases in a programming language.
**Definition** - A statement that introduces a name for a value or function and assigns a corresponding value or expression to it.
**Declaration** - A declaration is a statement that introduces a named entity into the program, such as a function, constant, or variable.
**Binding** - The process of creating a relationship between a value and a name. The `let` keyword binds the declaration (e.g., `x`) of type `&str` to the value ("λ").
**Constant** - Immutable data contained within a named memory location, referenced by its unique identifier.
**Mutation** - The act or process of being altered or changed.
**Variable** - Mutable data contained within a named memory location, referenced by its unique identifier.
**Delimiter** - A character or a sequence of characters that indicates the beginning or end of a specific construct.
**Scope** - Block-level, local, or global visibility in the context of program execution.

write 12 introductory synopsis for the topics in outline -> { analysis, market, cost, technical, specification objective, outline, timeline, implementation, operation, management, development}

- Outline
	- Analysis
		1. Market Analysis (How to find and evaluate problems)
			1. "Solving the right problems is just as important as asking the right questions, and in fact, they are reciprocal."
			2. this section teaches students how to ask the right questions to find the right problems to solve.
		2. Cost (how much will it cost to build, the financials of software engineering)
		3. Technical (feasibility study, constraints(time and cost))
	- Specification
		1. Objective (what being built)
		2. Outline (how its being built)
		3. Timeline(time to market )
	- Implementation
		1. Operations (Dev/Ops etc..)
		2. Management (Project Management )
		3. Development (Prompt to Production)





Analysis looks at finding problems worth solving so Market analysis is vital to that quest, once they find a problem they need to analyze  the cost to build, lastly technical analyses is about time to market given the current state of technology and feasibility  in relation to your timeline. Analysis is problem analysis, feasibility study, and cost and time constraints. Specification builds off analysis at this point students have a concrete problem they're working and specification outlines the problem they're trying to solve and how they are going to solve said problem

Communications on the frontend makes use of _URLSession_ in relation to **SwiftUI** and _KTOR_ in relation to **Jetpack Compose**. The backend is written in **Elixir**(Phoenix) with support for _Gleam_ where type safety is a concern. API's can also be implemented in _Go_ as an alternative if specific performance characteristic (cpu intensive processing) are a concern. GRPC is only the protocol of choice if the backend API is written in Go, else the default is Rest and Web sockets  with and Elixir and Phoenix backend API, with Gleam integration as needed. 

Protocol buffers and schema go hand in hand you should develop them together giving careful thought to how you effectively codify your schema. 





**Philosophy: Native, Mobile-First Design**

The strategy focuses on delivering exceptional user experiences by targeting all Apple platforms via **SwiftUI** and Android/Windows platforms using **Jetpack Compose**. By committing to these modern declarative frameworks, we eliminate the need for JavaScript entirely, prioritizing native performance and platform-specific functionality. Web-based applications inherently lack the performance characteristics and deep integration with native features that SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose provide. While maintaining separate codebases introduces additional complexity, this can be effectively mitigated through the strategic use of **code generation tools**, enabling efficient development workflows and reduced duplication. Both SwiftUI and Kotlin's declarative paradigms make them uniquely suited for this approach.

**A Changing Landscape: From Web 2.0 to an Application-Centric Era**

The traditional web, as defined by the **Web 2.0** era of search engines and indexed content, is rapidly losing relevance. Platforms like Instagram and YouTube have become the primary discovery channels, far surpassing the influence of Google Search for the emerging generations. The cultural shift toward an **application-centric ecosystem** has reshaped user habits and expectations. Google, once synonymous with innovation, now mirrors IBM in its twilight, just before its decline. **ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs)** symbolize the final disruption to the old web paradigm. These AI-driven tools streamline the process of discovery by sifting through the vast, irrelevant noise of the web, offering users concise, conversational answers instead of requiring them to comb through outdated search results.

Consider the user experience: Why scroll endlessly through Yelp reviews to find a restaurant when an LLM can distill recommendations instantly? Why manually hunt for solutions to a math problem when an AI can walk you through it step-by-step? Users naturally gravitate toward the **path of least resistance**, and LLMs have demonstrated a superior way to access information and solve problems.

**The Case Against Web-Based Applications**

From both user and developer perspectives, **web-based applications pale in comparison to native alternatives**. Native applications offer better performance, superior UX, and deeper integration with platform-specific capabilities. For developers, the complexity of building and maintaining modern web apps—dealing with countless frameworks, browser inconsistencies, and performance trade-offs—is often greater than managing separate codebases for native platforms. SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose streamline development with declarative paradigms, making the maintenance of native apps a more sustainable and productive path forward.

**Web3: A Break from Web2's Legacy**

Web3 will not look or behave like Web2. The emerging paradigm focuses on decentralized and application-driven experiences, leaving behind the bloated, index-driven structure of Web2. As the world moves toward an application-first mindset, embracing native development ensures alignment with the evolving needs of users and developers alike.
